How to handle the JS-2 files to get results:

Main HTML file is js-1.html, a web page.
Sibling folder (at same level as .html) is "assets". (You can move this folder elsewhere if you change js-1.html accordingly.)
Web page links to (loads) assets/styles.css, a very simple CSS file.
Web page has some HTML markup for title, header and text.
After body, web page loads a script file from assets with fcns.
After that, another Script section defines another function.
And then runs some "loose" Javascript commands.
How to show (and run) the web page: 8. Drag and drop the html file onto a browser to see what it does.

(*) Key: use fcn key F12 to open a "javascript console" in your browser and see what might be going wrong: errors and warnings.
